This Privacy Policy explains how Babylytics ("Babylytics," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects information when you use the Babylytics iOS app, Apple Watch app, widgets, and related services (collectively, the "App").

## 1. Accounts in Babylytics

You do not need to manually create an account to use Babylytics. An account is created automatically in the app. If you move to another device, account access can be restored using the in-app QR flow.

## 2. What Data Is Processed

To provide app functionality, Babylytics processes:

* App content that you enter and choose to sync.
* Technical and operational data needed to run and improve the app (for example diagnostics, analytics events, and push messaging token data when notifications are enabled).
* Luna AI chat prompts and responses when you use chat features.

## 3. Encryption and Access

Babylytics is designed so synced app content is encrypted before storage and transit. We do not use your encrypted app content for advertising, and we do not keep human-readable access to your encrypted values in normal operation.

No transmission or storage method is 100% secure, but we apply reasonable technical safeguards.

## 4. Why Data Is Processed

Data is processed to:

* Operate syncing, reminders, charts, and app features across devices.
* Deliver notifications if you enable them.
* Provide Luna AI chat responses when requested.
* Improve stability, performance, and reliability.
* Handle subscription and billing status through Apple.

## 5. Third-Party Processors

Babylytics uses third-party providers to deliver parts of the service:

* Supabase (authentication, sync, and storage)
* Firebase Analytics
* Firebase Crashlytics
* Firebase Remote Config
* Firebase Cloud Messaging
* OpenAI API (Luna chat)
* Apple (App Store payments and subscriptions)

These providers may process data under their own policies and terms.

## 6. Notifications

If you enable notifications, Babylytics can use local notifications and push infrastructure to deliver reminders. You can disable notifications at any time in iOS Settings.

## 7. Retention and Deletion

You can request deletion through in-app deletion controls. After deletion, we delete or anonymize account-related data we control, subject to legal and technical limits.

## 8. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your data. To make a request, contact us at the email below.

## 9. Children's Privacy

Babylytics is intended for parents and caregivers, not for direct use by children.

## 10. Policy Updates

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The date above reflects the latest version.
